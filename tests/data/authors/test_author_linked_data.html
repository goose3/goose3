				<p id="speakable-summary">Sketchy Facebook pages impersonating businesses are <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/26/ducktail-facebook-business-hijack-accounts/">nothing new</a>, but a flurry of recent scams is particularly brazen.</p>
<p>A handful of verified Facebook pages were hacked recently and spotted slinging likely malware through ads approved by and purchased through the platform. But the accounts should be easy to catch â€” in some cases, they were impersonating Facebook itself.</p>
<p>Social consultant Matt Navarra first spotted some of the ads, sharing them on Twitter. The compromised accounts include official-sounding pages like &#8220;Meta Ads&#8221; and &#8220;Meta Ads Manager.&#8221; Those accounts shared suspicious links to tens of thousands of followers, though their reach probably extended well beyond that through paid posts.</p>

<p></div>
<p>In another instance, a hacked verified account purporting to be &#8220;Google AI&#8221; pointed users toward fake links for Bard, Google&#8217;s AI chatbot. That account previously belonged to Indian singer and actress Miss Pooja before the account name was changed on April 29. That account, which operated for at least a decade, boasted more than 7 million followers.</p>

<p>Facebook now tracks and publicly displays a history of name changes for verified accounts â€” a welcome bit of transparency but a safeguard that apparently isn&#8217;t enough to flag some obvious scams.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s most egregious in these cases is that the hacked pages were not only impersonating major tech companies, <em>including</em> Meta itself, but that they were able to purchase Facebooks ads and go on to distribute suspicious download links. In spite of very recent account name changes, those ads were apparently approved without issue in Meta&#8217;s automated ads system.</p>
<p>All of the impersonator pages Navarra identified have since been disabled.</p>
<p>This week, Meta shared a report on a <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/03/malware-chatgpt-lures-facebook/">recent spate of AI-themed malware scams</a>. In those instances, hackers lure Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users to download malware by posing as popular AI chatbot tools like ChatGPT. One of those clusters of <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/07/26/ducktail-facebook-business-hijack-accounts/">malware known as DuckTail</a> has been plaguing businesses on Facebook for a few years now.</p>
<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s Carly Page explained this week:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meta says that attackers distributing the DuckTail malware have increasingly turned to these AI-themed lures in an attempt to compromise businesses with access to Facebook ad accounts. DuckTail, which has targeted Facebook users since 2021, steals browser cookies and hijacks logged-in Facebook sessions to steal information from the victimâ€™s Facebook account, including account information, location data and two-factor authentication codes. The malware also allows the threat actor to hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has access to.</p></blockquote>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the Facebook pages that impersonated Facebook and went on to buy malware-laden ads were compromised through DuckTail or malware like it.</p>
<p>&#8220;We invest significant resources into detecting and preventing scams and hacks,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;While many of the improvements weâ€™ve made are difficult to see â€“ because they minimize people from having issues in the first place â€“ scammers are always trying to get around our security measures.&#8221;</p>
<p>Impersonator accounts and compromised business pages have long been a headache for business owners across Facebook and Instagram. <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2023/03/17/meta-launches-paid-verification-on-instagram-and-facebook-in-the-us/">Meta Verified</a>, the company&#8217;s newly launched verification program, is positioned to improve the company&#8217;s notoriously thin level of customer support for businesses that rely on its apps. Controversially, Meta&#8217;s promising offer of &#8220;proactive account protection&#8221; isn&#8217;t a free improvement â€” Instagram and Facebook accounts will need to pay $14.99 a month to secure the higher level of customer support, a price many businesses will likely begrudgingly pay to avoid drowning in a sea of scam accounts.</p>

But the first step is to have hard law.<\/p>\n<p>Commenting after the vote in a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.europarl.europa.eu\/news\/en\/press-room\/20230505IPR84904\/ai-act-a-step-closer-to-the-first-rules-on-artificial-intelligence\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">statement<\/a>, co-rapporteur and MEP Dragos Tudorache, added:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Given the profound transformative impact AI will have on our societies and economies, the AI Act is very likely the most important piece of legislation in this mandate. It\u2019s the first piece of legislation of this kind worldwide, which means that the EU can lead the way in making AI human-centric, trustworthy and safe. We have worked to support AI innovation in Europe and to give start-ups, SMEs and industry space to grow and innovate, while protecting fundamental rights, strengthening democratic oversight and ensuring a mature system of AI governance and enforcement.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>A plenary vote in parliament to seal the mandate is expected next month (during the 12-15 June session), after which trilogue talks will kick off with the Council toward agreeing a final compromise on the file.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/21\/europe-lays-out-plan-for-risk-based-ai-rules-to-boost-trust-and-uptake\/\">Back in 2021<\/a>, when the Commission&#8217; presented its draft proposal for the AI Act it suggested the risk-based framework would create a blueprint for &#8220;human&#8221; and &#8220;trustworthy&#8221; AI. However <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations\/\">concerns were quickly raised<\/a> that the plan fell far short of the mark &#8212; including in areas related to biometric surveillance, with the Commission only proposing a limited ban on use of highly intrusive technology like facial recognition in public.<\/p>\n<p>Civil society groups and EU bodies pressed for amendments to bolster protections for fundamental rights &#8212; with the European Data Protection Supervisor and European Data Protection Board among those <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/06\/21\/ban-biometric-surveillance-in-public-to-safeguard-rights-urge-eu-bodies\/\">calling for the legislation to go further<\/a> and urging EU lawmakers to put a total ban on biometrics surveillance in public.<\/p>\n<p>MEPs appear to have largely heeded civil society&#8217;s call. Although concerns do remain. (And of course it remains to be seen how the proposal MEPs have strengthened could get watered back down again as Member States governments enter the negotiations in the coming months.)<\/p>\n<p>Other changes parliamentarians agreed in today&#8217;s committee votes include expansions to the regulation&#8217;s (fixed) classification of &#8220;high-risk&#8221; areas &#8212; to include harm to people\u2019s health, safety, fundamental rights and the environment.<\/p>\n<p>AI systems used to influence voters in political campaigns and those used in recommender systems by larger social media platforms (with more than 45 million users, aligning with the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/04\/25\/europe-names-19-platforms-that-must-report-algorithmic-risks-under-dsa\/\">VLOPs classification in the Digital Services Act<\/a>), were also put on the high-risk list.<\/p>\n<p>At the same time, though, MEPs backed changes to what counts as high risk &#8212; proposing to leave it up to AI developers to decide if their system is significant enough to meet the bar where obligations applying, something digital rights groups are warning (see below) is &#8220;a major red flag&#8221; for enforcing the rules.<\/p>\n<p class=\"ep-wysiwig_paragraph\">Elsewhere, MEPs backed amendments aimed at boosting citizens\u2019 right to file complaints about AI systems and receive explanations of decisions based on high-risk AI systems that &#8220;significantly&#8221; impact their rights.<\/p>\n<p>The lack of meaningful redress for individuals affected by harmful AIs was a major loophole raised by civil society groups in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations\/\">a major call for revisions in fall 2021<\/a> who pointed out the glaring difference between the Commission&#8217;s AI Act proposal and the bloc&#8217;s General Data Protection Act, under which individuals can complain to regulators and pursue other forms of redress.<\/p>\n<p>Another change MEPs agree on today is a reformed role for body called the EU AI Office, which they want to monitor how the rulebook is implemented &#8212; to supplement decentralized oversight of the regulation at the Member State level.<\/p>\n<p>While, in a nod to the perennial industry cry that too much regulation is harmful for &#8220;innovation&#8221;, they also added exemptions to rules for research activities and AI components provided under open-source licenses, while noting the law promotes regulatory sandboxes, or controlled environments, being established by public authorities to test AI before its deployment.<\/p>\n<p>Digital rights group EDRi, which has been urging major revisions to the Commission draft, said everything it had been pushing for was passed by MEPs &#8220;in some form or another&#8221; &#8212; flagging particularly the (now) full ban on facial recognition in public; along with (new) bans on predictive policing, emotion recognition and on other harmful uses of AI.<\/p>\n<p>Another key win it points to is the inclusion of accountability and transparency obligations on deployers of high risk AI &#8212; applying on them a duty to do a fundamental rights impact assessment and mechanisms by which people affected can challenge AI systems.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The Parliament is sending a clear message to governments and AI developers with its list of bans, ceding civil society\u2019s demands that some uses of AI are just too harmful to be allowed, Sarah Chander, EDRi senior policy advisor,&#8221; told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This new text is a vast improvement from the Commission&#8217;s original proposal when it comes to reigning in the abuse of sensitive data about our faces, bodies, and identities,&#8221; added,\u00a0<span class=\"qu\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"gridcell\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"gD\" data-hovercard-id=\"ella.jakubowska@edri.org\" data-hovercard-owner-id=\"121\">Ella Jakubowska, an EDRi senior policy advisor who has focused on biometrics.\u00a0<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p>However EDRi said there are still areas of concern &#8212; pointing to use of AI for migration control as one big one.<\/p>\n<p>On this, Chander noted that MEPs failed to include in the list of prohibited practices where AI is used to facilitate &#8220;illegal pushbacks&#8221;, or to profile people in a discriminatory manner &#8212; which is <a href=\"https:\/\/edri.org\/our-work\/civil-society-calls-for-the-eu-ai-act-to-better-protect-people-on-the-move\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">something EDRi had called for<\/a>. &#8220;Unfortunately, the [European Parliament&#8217;s] support for peoples\u2019 rights stops short of protecting migrants from AI harms, including where AI is used to facilitate pushbacks,&#8221; she said, suggesting: &#8220;Without these prohibitions the European Parliament is opening the door for a\u00a0 panopticon at the EU border.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The group said it would also like to see improvements to the proposed ban on predictive policing &#8212; to cover location based predictive policing which Chander described as &#8220;essentially a form of automated racial profiling&#8221;. She said it&#8217;s worried that the proposed remote biometrics identification ban won&#8217;t cover the full extent of mass surveillance practices it&#8217;s seen being used across Europe.<i><br \/>\n<\/i><\/p>\n<p>&#8220;Whilst the Parliament&#8217;s approach is very comprehensive [on biometrics], there are a few practices that we would like to see even further restricted. Whilst there is a ban on retrospective public facial recognition, it contains an exception for law enforcement use which we still consider to be too risky. In particular, it could incentivise mass retention of CCTV footage and biometric data, which we would clearly oppose,&#8221; added <span class=\"qu\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"gridcell\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"gD\" data-hovercard-id=\"ella.jakubowska@edri.org\" data-hovercard-owner-id=\"121\">Jakubowska, saying it would also want to see <\/span><\/span>the EU outlaw emotion recognition no matter the context &#8212; &#8220;as this &#8216;technology&#8217; is fundamentally flawed, unscientific, and discriminatory by design&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Another concern EDRi flags is MEPs&#8217; proposal to let AI developers judge if their systems are high risk or not &#8212; as this risk undermining enforceability.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cUnfortunately, the Parliament is proposing some very worrying changes relating to what counts as &#8216;high-risk AI. With the changes in the text, developers will be able to decide if their system is &#8216;significant&#8217; enough to be considered high risk, a major red flag for the enforcement of this legislation,&#8221; Chander suggested.<\/p>\n<p>While today&#8217;s committee vote is a big step towards setting the parliament&#8217;s mandate &#8212; and setting the tone for the upcoming trilogue talks with the Council &#8212; much could still change and there is likely to be some pushback from Member States governments, which tend to be more focused on national security considerations than caring for fundamental rights.<\/p>\n<p>Asked whether it&#8217;s expecting the Council to try to unpick some of the expanded protections against biometric surveillance <span class=\"qu\" tabindex=\"-1\" role=\"gridcell\" translate=\"no\"><span class=\"gD\" data-hovercard-id=\"ella.jakubowska@edri.org\" data-hovercard-owner-id=\"121\">Jakubowska said: &#8220;<\/span><\/span>We can see from the Council&#8217;s general approach last year that they want to water down the already insufficient protections in the Commission&#8217;s original text. Despite having no credible evidence of effectiveness &#8212; and lots of evidence of the harms &#8212; we see that many member state governments are keen to retain the ability to conduct biometric mass surveillance.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;They often do this under the pretence of &#8216;national security&#8217; such as <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/24\/paris-olympics-biometrics-surveillance\/\">in the case of the French Olympics and Paralympics<\/a>, and\/or as part of broader trends criminalising migration and other minoritised communities. That being said, we saw what could be considered &#8216;dissenting opinions&#8217; from both Austria and Germany, who both favour stronger protections of biometric data in the AI Act. And we&#8217;ve heard rumours that several other countries are willing to make compromises in the direction of the biometrics provisions. This gives us hope that there will be a positive outcome from the trilogues, even though we of course expect a strong push back from several Member States.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Giving another early assessment from civil society, <span class=\"gD\" data-hovercard-id=\"kris.shrishak@iccl.ie\" data-hovercard-owner-id=\"84\">Kris Shrishak, a senior fellow at <\/span>the Irish Council for Civil Liberties (ICCL), which also joined the 2021 call for major revisions to the AI Act, also cautioned over enforcement challenges &#8212; warning that while the parliament has strengthened enforceability by amendments that explicitly allow regulators to perform remote inspections, he suggested MEPs are simultaneously tying regulators hands by preventing them access to source code of AI systems for investigations.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We are also concerned that we will see a repeat of GDPR-like enforcement problems,&#8221; he told TechCrunch.<\/p>\n<p>On the plus side he said MEPs have taken a step towards addressing &#8220;the shortcomings&#8221; of the Commission&#8217;s definition of AI systems &#8212; notably with generative AI systems being brought in scope and the application of transparency obligations on them, which he dubbed &#8220;a key step towards addressing their harms&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>But &#8212; on the issue of copyright and AI training data &#8212; <span class=\"gD\" data-hovercard-id=\"kris.shrishak@iccl.ie\" data-hovercard-owner-id=\"84\">Shrishak<\/span> was critical of the lack of a&#8221;firm stand&#8221; by MEPs to stop data mining giants from ingesting information for free, including copyright-protected data.<\/p>\n<p>The copyright amendment only requires companies to provide a summary of copyright-protected data used for training &#8212; suggesting it will be left up to rights holders to sue.<\/p>\n<p>Asked about possible concerns that exemptions for research activities and AI components provided under open source licenses might create fresh loopholes for AI giants to escape the rules, he agreed that&#8217;s a worry.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;<span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Research is a loophole that is carried over from the scope of the regulation. This is likely to be exploited by companies,&#8221; he suggested. &#8220;In the context of AI it is a big loophole considering large parts of the research is taking place in companies. We already see Google saying they are &#8216;experimenting&#8217; with Bard. Further to this, I expect some companies to claim that they develop AI components and not AI systems (I already heard this from one large corporation during discussions on General purpose AI. This was one of their arguments for why GPAI [general purpose AI] should not be regulated).&#8221;<\/span><\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"8YW0v0RqAs\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations\/\">Europe&#8217;s AI Act falls far short on protecting fundamental rights, civil society groups warn<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;Europe&#8217;s AI Act falls far short on protecting fundamental rights, civil society groups warn&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/11\/30\/eu-ai-act-civil-society-recommendations\/embed\/#?secret=OQ9WVC8ES3#?secret=8YW0v0RqAs\" data-secret=\"8YW0v0RqAs\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In a series of votes in the European Parliament this morning MEPs have backed a raft of amendments to the bloc&#8217;s draft AI legislation &#8212; including agreeing a set of requirements for so called foundational models which underpin generative AI technologies like OpenAI&#8217;s ChatGPT.

href=\"https:\/\/smartbear.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">SmartBear<\/a>, a provider of software development and visibility tools. The company has completed eight acquisitions in less than five years.\t<\/div>\n\t\n\t<\/div>\n<\/div><p id=\"speakable-summary\"><span class=\"featured__span-first-words\">Mergers and acquisitions<\/span> (M&amp;A) have long been a driving force for companies seeking exponential growth, gaining market share and creating shareholder value. History has shown that well-executed M&amp;A strategies can be transformative and yield impressive results.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, Disney&#8217;s acquisition of Pixar in 2006 revitalized the animation giant&#8217;s fortunes, though market analysts were skeptical of this move when it was announced. In a conversation with <a href=\"https:\/\/www.cnbc.com\/2021\/12\/21\/disneys-bob-iger-says-pixar-was-probably-the-best-acquisition-as-ceo.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">CNBC<\/a> 15 years later, Bob Iger stated it was perhaps the best acquisition decision during his time at Disney. &#8220;It put us on the path to achieving what I wanted to achieve, which is scale when it comes to storytelling,&#8221; were his exact words.<\/p>\n<p>But the Disney-Pixar marriage isn&#8217;t the only one that proved to be a massive growth engine. Facebook&#8217;s purchase of Instagram in 2012 allowed the social media behemoth to dominate the photo-sharing space. There are many such examples in the history of businesses around the world.<\/p>\n<p>But all&#8217;s not rosy in the world of M&amp;A. It is a complex and substantially risky decision, not for the faint-hearted. It is essential to approach the decision and process with diligence and forethought.<\/p>\n<p>Over the years, with experience navigating the complicated world of M&amp;A, including eight acquisitions in just the past few years, I have built five indispensable elements to consider for a successful mergers and acquisitions journey.<\/p>\n<h2>Be watchful of revenue synergies<strong>\u00a0<\/strong><\/h2>\n<p>One of the critical drivers of a successful acquisition is the ability to achieve revenue synergies. However, what&#8217;s more important is not to assume this synergy will automatically occur just because it seems feasible.<\/p>\n<p>Making a decision about consolidated revenue potential after the M&amp;A involves carefully analyzing the potential for growth and gaining clear visibility into how to maximize synergy. Consider acquiring companies with high sales velocity and exponential growth potential to maximize success. Analyze the target&#8217;s product offerings, customer base and sales channels to identify cross-selling, upselling and market expansion opportunities.<\/p>\n<p>For instance, in 2015, PayPal acquired Braintree, a payments company that owned the mobile payment service, Venmo. It was a strategic and wise move at a time when digital payments were just taking off across the globe. Now in <a href=\"https:\/\/www.paymentsdive.com\/news\/paypal-venmo-P2P-Amazon-payments-growth\/644223\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2023<\/a>, PayPal is relying on Venmo to drive the adoption and usage of the company&#8217;s digital payments services. The two operations are expected to converge by next year. This acquisition has enabled PayPal to tap into the growing peer-to-peer payments market and strengthen its revenue streams.<\/p>\n<h2>Don&#8217;t let refactoring throw cold water on your go-to-market strategy<\/h2>\n<p>Tech CEOs often make the mistake of assuming that a product will seamlessly integrate into their existing tech stack, especially in a tuck-in acquisition. However, this may not always be the case.<\/p>\n<p>Before making your decision about the acquisition, take the time to evaluate the target company&#8217;s go-to-market (GTM) strategy and the ease of finding, buying and deploying their products.

ATT faces competition probe in Italy"},"content":{"rendered":"<p id=\"speakable-summary\">Apple is facing another antitrust investigation in Europe over privacy rules it applies to third party apps running on its mobile platform which affect their ability to track iOS users in order to target them with advertising.<\/p>\n<p>Italy&#8217;s competition watchdog said today it&#8217;s concerned Apple may be creating an unfair advantage for its own &#8216;personalized&#8217; ads which are not subject to the same permission pop-up it requires for third parties to track iOS users.<\/p>\n<p>Apple launched the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/26\/apples-app-tracking-transparency-feature-has-arrived-heres-what-you-need-to-know\/\">App Tracking Transparency<\/a> (ATT) feature just over two years ago, requiring third party apps obtain opt-in consent from users to be tracked for ads. The move was <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2020\/12\/08\/apple-takes-aim-at-adtech-hysteria-over-ios-app-tracking-change\/\">decried by the ad industry<\/a> &#8212; and quickly led to a number of complaints being filed with competition authorities. So Italy is by no means the first to probe Apple&#8217;s privacy measure.<\/p>\n<p>In a <a href=\"https:\/\/www.agcm.it\/media\/comunicati-stampa\/2023\/5\/A561\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">press release<\/a> today the Italian AGCM announced the launch of an investigation into Apple for alleged abuse of a dominant position in the app market &#8212; saying it suspects the company of applying a more &#8220;restrictive&#8221; privacy policy to app developers than the one it applies to itself. This in turn means third parties are likely to be at a disadvantage when it comes to the &#8220;quality and detail&#8221; of data made available to them by Apple, it suggested, including relating to the effectiveness of their ad campaigns on iOS.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;This happens due to the technical characteristics of the programming interface they can access &#8212; SkAdNetwork &#8212; which appears much less effective than Apple Ads Attribution, the tool that Apple adopts for itself,&#8221; the AGCM wrote in a statement [NB: this is a machine translation of the original Italian text].<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;The availability of data relating to both user profiling and the measurement of the effectiveness of advertising campaigns &#8212; while in compliance with privacy protection regulations &#8212; are essential elements for the attractiveness of the advertising spaces sold by app developers and purchased by advertisers. For this reason, according to the Authority, Apple&#8217;s alleged discriminatory conduct may cause a drop in advertising revenue from third-party advertisers, to the benefit of its commercial division; reduce entry and\/or prevent competitors from remaining in the app development and distribution market; benefit their own apps and, consequently, mobile devices and the Apple iOS operating system.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>The AGCM added that it&#8217;s concerned Apple&#8217;s behavior could reduce incentives to develop innovative apps and create barriers for consumers to switch mobile ecosystems.<\/p><div class=\"piano-inline-promo\"><\/div>\n<p>Apple was contacted for comment on the AGCM&#8217;s investigation.<\/p>\n<p>Since the Apple-imposed iOS limit on third party tracking rolled out a number of studies have also <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/09\/06\/one-year-later-apples-privacy-changes-helped-boost-its-own-ads-business-report-finds\/\">suggested the move lifted Apple&#8217;s own ad business<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/04\/08\/apple-att-impact-study\/\">boosted its market power<\/a>.

Although the French competition authority said it would continue to investigate.<\/p>\n<p>Antitrust watchdogs in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/14\/apple-att-germany-fco-antitrust\/\">Germany<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/13\/poland-apple-att-antitrust-probe\/\">Poland<\/a> have also announced probes of Apple&#8217;s approach since ATT launched. While the UK&#8217;s Competition and Markets Authority raised substantial concerns about Apple&#8217;s market power generally, in a wide-ranging mobile market ecosystem review <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/12\/14\/cma-mobile-ecosystem-market-study\/\">towards the end of 2021<\/a> (and again in a final report in <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/06\/10\/apple-google-mobile-duopoly-cma-market-study\/\">June 2022<\/a>). And it has an open <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/03\/04\/apples-app-store-is-now-also-under-antitrust-scrutiny-in-the-uk\/\">investigation into Apple&#8217;s App Store following complaints of unfairness by developers<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Back in the EU, antitrust action by the bloc&#8217;s competition commission against Apple in recent years has focused on the <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2021\/04\/30\/europe-charges-apple-with-antitrust-breach-citing-spotify-app-store-complaint\/\">music streaming market<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/05\/02\/apple-faces-charges-over-apple-pay-following-eu-antitrust-complaint\/\">Apple Pay<\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/02\/28\/eu-antitrust-regulators-target-apples-anti-steering-developer-restrictions-but-drop-in-app-purchases-case\/\">in-app payments-related conditions<\/a>. But one thing to note is that self-preferencing is set to be banned in the region for tech giants designated as so-called Internet &#8220;gatekeepers&#8221; under a major ex ante competition reform that&#8217;s aimed at curbing Big Tech&#8217;s market power.<\/p>\n<p>The pan-EU <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/dma-applies\/\">Digital Markets Act<\/a> (DMA) applies to &#8220;core platform services&#8221; operated by gatekeepers.<\/p>\n<p>Apple&#8217;s App Store is a likely candidate for falling under the DMA regime. If that happens, requirements against self-preferencing and fair dealing with third parties will apply &#8212; and could, potentially, affect how it can operate ATT (which is a feature of the App Store).<\/p>\n<p>That said, the bloc&#8217;s data protection rulebook (GDPR) also applies so any moves to impose conditions on Apple with the goal of enhancing competition would need to avoid causing privacy harms for consumers in the process, requiring a balance of considerations.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lixG5orl67\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/dma-applies\/\">New rules in Europe to curb Big Tech&#8217;s market power start to apply<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;New rules in Europe to curb Big Tech&#8217;s market power start to apply&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/05\/02\/dma-applies\/embed\/#?secret=G4n2xYynSP#?secret=lixG5orl67\" data-secret=\"lixG5orl67\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Apple is facing another antitrust investigation in Europe over privacy rules it applies to third party apps running on its mobile platform which affect their ability to track iOS users in order to target them with advertising.

Well, the market does, actually; the mobile phone has all but killed off the category altogether, so it&#8217;s interesting to see Canon take another stab at the market. The PowerShot series of cameras today gained its newest family member, the V10.<\/p>\n<p>The main question this product has to overcome is &#8216;why not just use your phone,&#8217; and the camera nerd in me is relieved to have a good answer: Phone cameras are great, but they have to be small. With that restriction removed, Canon can do what Canon does best: Build cameras. On paper, the little camera looks great; it is built around a 1-inch CMOS sensor. That alone is a big deal; phone cameras are getting good enough now that we are right at the edge of what physics can do for us: Sensors get hot, and with all those pixels packed into a tiny space, and limitations on how good and precise lenses can be, you&#8217;re butting up against the practical maximum image quality you can get.<\/p>\n<p>If you want to get better from there, you need to add smarts (i.e. image processing enhancements, which is increasingly AI-powered), or shift to bigger sensors.\u00a0Canon&#8217;s Powershot V10 treats us to both: it has 14 built-in color filters and &#8216;Smooth Skin&#8217; mode to help you look your best.<\/p>\n<p>The sturdy vertical body is an entirely new design for Canon &#8211; and it makes a lot of sense in a world where these cameras are more likely to be placed somewhere to film yourself, than hand-held and shooting. Which is an additional point: Smartphone cameras are getting great, but a lot of this kind of content is filmed with the selfie camera, which is often lower resolution and quality than the rear-facing cameras. Canon&#8217;s V10 resolves that by making the screen flippable, and you get the best of both worlds: Full-quality camera and a preview to frame your shot.<\/p>\n<p>Canon&#8217;s newest helps make it possible to shoot in both vertical and horizontal orientations, matching the various social media platforms. If you&#8217;re wanting to use the camera as a webcam, streaming cam, or content production cam, it has you covered, whether you&#8217;re shooting for YouTube, TikTok, or &#8211; a favorite among home chefs &#8211; OnlyPans. <span style=\"font-size: 1rem; letter-spacing: -0.1px;\">Whatever else the cool kids are doing with their video, Canon hopes it can win folks over.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>The camera includes two high-quality stereo microphones, and a third microphone added to aid noise reduction. It also connects with the Canon Camera Connect app to transfer videos over Wi-Fi (no more messing about with memory cards!) and the camera has USB ports to easily transfer to a computer at higher speeds, or to be used as a web cam.<\/p>\n<p><div id=\"attachment_2541822\" style=\"width: 1034px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-2541822\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-2541822\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg 1280w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=150,105 150w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=300,211 300w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=768,540 768w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=680,478 680w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=1200,844 1200w, https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/05\/adjustable.jpeg?resize=50,35 50w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><p id=\"caption-attachment-2541822\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">The V10&#8217;s adjustable stand means you don&#8217;t have a lug a tripod with you everywhere.

The standard kit includes a power cable, soft case, lens cap, windshield and wrist strap. For those who want more creative options, an advanced kit includes a cage that can be used to attach additional lighting options or hold an external microphones etc.<\/p>\n<p>Starting at $429, the camera is well-priced to be positioned as cheaper and better than a smartphone and a stepping stone on the way up to a full-size interchangeable lens camera.<\/p>\n<p>Canon produced a video to show how it all works, along with some sample footage from the camera:<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--video embed--youtube\"><iframe class=\"embed-iframe embed-iframe--youtube\" title=\"Introducing the Canon PowerShot V10 Vlog Cam for Content Creators\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XbPJPXZKM5o?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\" allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who says compact cameras are dead?

In those instances, hackers lure Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp users to download malware by posing as popular AI chatbot tools like ChatGPT. One of those clusters of <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/ducktail-facebook-business-hijack-accounts\/\">malware known as DuckTail<\/a> has been plaguing businesses on Facebook for a few years now.<\/p>\n<p>As TechCrunch&#8217;s Carly Page explained this week:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>Meta says that attackers distributing the DuckTail malware have increasingly turned to these AI-themed lures in an attempt to compromise businesses with access to Facebook ad accounts. DuckTail, which has targeted Facebook users since 2021, steals browser cookies and hijacks logged-in Facebook sessions to steal information from the victim\u2019s Facebook account, including account information, location data and two-factor authentication codes. The malware also allows the threat actor to hijack any Facebook Business account that the victim has access to.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>It&#8217;s possible that the Facebook pages that impersonated Facebook and went on to buy malware-laden ads were compromised through DuckTail or malware like it.<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;We invest significant resources into detecting and preventing scams and hacks,&#8221; a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch. &#8220;While many of the improvements we\u2019ve made are difficult to see \u2013 because they minimize people from having issues in the first place \u2013 scammers are always trying to get around our security measures.&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>Impersonator accounts and compromised business pages have long been a headache for business owners across Facebook and Instagram. <a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2023\/03\/17\/meta-launches-paid-verification-on-instagram-and-facebook-in-the-us\/\">Meta Verified<\/a>, the company&#8217;s newly launched verification program, is positioned to improve the company&#8217;s notoriously thin level of customer support for businesses that rely on its apps. Controversially, Meta&#8217;s promising offer of &#8220;proactive account protection&#8221; isn&#8217;t a free improvement \u2014 Instagram and Facebook accounts will need to pay $14.99 a month to secure the higher level of customer support, a price many businesses will likely begrudgingly pay to avoid drowning in a sea of scam accounts.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embed breakout embed-oembed embed--techcrunch\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"lWr0EpUthp\"><p><a href=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/ducktail-facebook-business-hijack-accounts\/\">A newly discovered malware hijacks Facebook Business accounts<\/a><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" style=\"position: absolute; clip: rect(1px, 1px, 1px, 1px);\" title=\"&#8220;A newly discovered malware hijacks Facebook Business accounts&#8221; &#8212; TechCrunch\" src=\"https:\/\/techcrunch.com\/2022\/07\/26\/ducktail-facebook-business-hijack-accounts\/embed\/#?secret=rEBsaCS8Dg#?secret=lWr0EpUthp\" data-secret=\"lWr0EpUthp\" width=\"800\" height=\"450\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"><\/iframe><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Sketchy Facebook pages impersonating businesses are nothing new, but a flurry of recent scams is particularly brazen.
