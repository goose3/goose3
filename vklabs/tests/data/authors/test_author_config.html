        TextNode 1 - The Scala supported IDE is one of the few pain points of developers who want to start using Scala
        in their Java project. On existing long term project developed by a team its hard to step in and introduce a new
        language that is not supported by the existing IDE. On way to go about it is to hid the fact that you use Scala
        from the Java world by using one way dependency injection. Still, if you wish to truly absorb Scala into your
        existing java environment then you'll soon introduced cross language dependencies.
