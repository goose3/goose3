        "cleaned_text": "\"Head to the supermarket an hour before closing time. Some stores mark down prepared foods and bakery items then because they can't sell them the following day. You could get a rotisserie chicken or freshly baked cookies for 50 percent off, or nab two sushi meals for the price of one. If you're planning to host a party or some other gathering, it's worth your time to ask the deli or bakery manager for a 5 to 10 percent discount off your catering order. Also, keep an eye out for online coupons: Some grocery stores accept coupons printed out from sites like TheGroceryGame.com, ShopAtHome.com, and CouponMom.com, even though they rarely publicize the fact. (Find out your store's policy at the customer-service counter.) It also pays to check the market's own website. You could find weekly deals there that it doesn't advertise anywhere else, including its in-store flyers.\n\n\"And even though it's convenient to do all your shopping in one place, avoid going to a grocery store for kitchen supplies, like measuring cups and cookie sheets, or seasonal items, like holiday decorations and gift bags. These products will have inflated prices. Buy them at a big-box chain, like Target or Walmart, instead.\"\n\nMore from Bing and MSN Lifestyle Site Search: Get additional content on saving on your grocery bill",
